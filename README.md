# RNAseq_workflow
This repository and workflow documents are intended to document how we run our RNA-seq analyses and help those who have not 
previously analyzed RNA-seq data to be able to walk through the workflow step-by-step. If you wish to read through the 
analysis workflow and look at example figures without running the code, you can read the RNAseq_workflow_revised.html document.
If you wish to run the code on the sample data provided, make sure to download all files from GitHub, then use the 
RNAseq_workflow_revised.Rmd document in R to run the individual code chunks or the entire document. It will be helpful to 
familiarize yourself with R Markdown if it is new to you. You can read more about it here:

If you wish to process the fastq files or have any additional questions, please email kinsey.fisher@duke.edu.
